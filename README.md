This is a web version of MotoMeter, which is available on Android devices through the Play Store at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slack.motometer

MotoMeter is designed to help you keep track of the required maintenance on your dirt bike(s). 

You can create multiple bike profiles and any number of maintenance tasks to track for each profile. 

After finishing a track/ride day you simply update the profile with the bike's new hourmeter reading 
and the app will calculate the remaining time for the tracked tasks. 

The app also provides an optional pre-ride checklist activity and a notes section for each profile. 

The notes section is intended to allow you to consolidate any maintenance related information 
i.e. torques, dimensions, specifications, maintenance instructions, etc.


This version was created only for personal education but is currently hosted on Heroku servers at: 
https://motometer-web.herokuapp.com. 
It is hosted on a free tier so it will likely take some time to spool up.
